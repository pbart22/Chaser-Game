# Who Let the Dog Out!!

In this game you play as a dog who has been locked up for many weeks in the dog pound eating nothing but the processed garbage the pound likes to label as "high quality" dog food. Until one day, the guard on duty, Lawrence, got lazy and did not lock up your cage. Once Lawrence walks around the corner, you seize the opportunity and bust out of your cage and head for the door. Now you are on the run, and the dog catchers have been sent out to capture you. Your goal is to avoid the dog catchers for as long as possible to soak up and enjoy your newfound freedom and eat as many delicious dog treats that you can find. Good luck!

How to Play: 

1. Click to start the game.

2. To move your character, just drag the mouse.

3. Dog treats and heart powerups will spawn randomly throughout the game play, for every treat you collect one dog catcher will disappear, and for every heart you pick up your health will increase slightly.

4. For every 5 dog treats collected you will move up a level.

5. If you bump into a dog catcher your health will drop, once you run out of health, the game will end as you have been caught.

6. If you want to keep playing, just click to restart.
